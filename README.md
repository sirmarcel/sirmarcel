Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcel, a postdoc in the [COSMO Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cosmo/) at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. Previously, I was a doctoral student at the [Fritz Haber Institute](https://fhi.mpg.de) (in the [NOMAD Laboratory](https://nomad-lab.eu)) and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin) (in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/)).

I work on applying machine learning to materials science problems. Recently, I've particularly focused on machine-learning potentials and the computation of thermal conductivities with the Green-Kubo method. To this end, I've written the [`glp`](https://github.com/sirmarcel/glp) and [`gkx`](https://github.com/sirmarcel/gkx) packages, both using `jax`.

Here are some other places on the internet you can have a look at:

- [I'm also on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sirmarcel)
- [marcel.science](https://marcel.science) is my science website
- [marcel.computer](https://marcel.computer) is my personal website

Thanks for stopping by ðŸš€
