Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcel, a doctoral student at the [Fritz Haber Institute](https://fhi.mpg.de) (in the [NOMAD Laboratory](https://nomad-lab.eu)) and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin) (in the [Machine Learning group)](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/). 

I work on applying machine learning to materials science problems. [cmlkit](https://marcel.science/cmlkit) is a small toolkit for that purpose!

Here are some other places on the internet you can have a look at:

- [I'm on twitter](https://twitter.com/marceldotsci)
- [I'm also on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sirmarcel) (the activity graph on there is also a bit more... filled ðŸ˜‰)
- [marcel.science](https://marcel.science) is my science website
- [marcel.computer](https://marcel.computer) is my personal website

Thanks for stopping by ðŸš€
