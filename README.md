Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcel, a doctoral student at the [Fritz Haber Institute](https://fhi.mpg.de) (in the [NOMAD Laboratory](https://nomad-lab.eu)) and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin) (in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/)).

I work on applying machine learning to materials science problems. Recently, I've particularly focused on machine-learning potentials and the computation of thermal conductivities with the Green-Kubo method. To this end, I've written the [`glp`](https://github.com/sirmarcel/glp) and [`gkx`](https://github.com/sirmarcel/gkx) packages, both using `jax`.

Here are some other places on the internet you can have a look at:

- [I'm on twitter](https://twitter.com/marceldotsci)
- [I'm also on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sirmarcel) (the activity graph on there is also a bit more... filled ðŸ˜‰)
- [marcel.science](https://marcel.science) is my science website
- [marcel.computer](https://marcel.computer) is my personal website
- [here's my google scholar profile page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NNCidQsAAAAJ&hl=en)

Thanks for stopping by ðŸš€
